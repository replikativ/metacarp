# carp-compiler

A self-hosting compiler for [Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp), written
in Carp. It reads Carp source and emits a C translation unit, driving the whole
pipeline — module loading, macro expansion, name resolution, type inference,
interface specialization, ownership and borrow checking, and C code generation —
in Carp itself.

> **Status: self-hosting.** The compiler compiles itself, and the result
> compiles the compiler again to byte-identical C — a fixed point. Both
> generations pass the reference compiler's test suite (154 entries: examples,
> output tests, error-rejection tests, benches). It is still not a drop-in
> replacement for the reference compiler (see [Limitations](#limitations)).

## Build

Requires the reference [Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp) compiler and a
C compiler (`clang`). Building bootstraps the roughly 42,000 lines of compiler
source through reference Carp:

```sh
carp -b --optimize main.carp
```

This produces `./out/carp-compiler`.

## Usage

```
carp-compiler [options] <source.carp>

  -b, --build           compile to an executable instead of C (needs --core)
  -x, --execute         compile to an executable and run it (needs --core)
  -c, --core <dir>      compile against the Carp standard library in <dir>
  -o, --output <file>   output path — the C file, or the executable under -b
  --optimize            build -b/-x executables with clang -O3 -D NDEBUG
  --no-core             skip the implicit Core load; the source's own
                        (load "X.carp") directives still resolve in --core
  -h, --help            show this help and exit
  -v, --version         show version and exit
```

With no `-b`/`-x`, the C translation unit is written to standard output (or
`-o`). Diagnostics go to standard error and name the rejecting compiler phase.
`-b`/`-x` require `--core`, because linking needs the runtime headers the
standard library ships with.

`(load ...)` resolves like the reference compiler's: relative to the loading
file, then the Core directory — and git references install into the shared
cache (`~/.cache/carp/libs/...`) on first use:

```clojure
(load "git@github.com:carpentry-org/strbuf@0.2.0")
```

The examples below assume `CARP_DIR` points at a checkout of the reference
Carp repository (its `core/` is the standard library and runtime headers).

Compile a standalone program (no standard library) to C:

```sh
./out/carp-compiler examples/hello.carp \
  | clang -x c -I "$CARP_DIR/core" -o /tmp/carp-hello -
/tmp/carp-hello        # prints: OK
```

Compile and run a program that uses the standard library:

```sh
./out/carp-compiler -x -c "$CARP_DIR/core" examples/squares.carp
# sum of squares of the even numbers in 1..10 = 220
```

## Self-hosting

The bootstrap chain, from the repository root:

```sh
carp -b --optimize main.carp                                    # gen 1
./out/carp-compiler -c "$CARP_DIR/core" -o self.c main.carp     # gen 1 emits itself
clang -O3 -D NDEBUG -o self-cc self.c -I "$CARP_DIR/core"      # link gen 2
./self-cc -c "$CARP_DIR/core" -o self2.c main.carp              # gen 2 emits itself
cmp self.c self2.c                                              # fixed point
```

The canonical generation benchmark compares reference Carp, gen 1, and gen 2
on the same workload (generating C for `main.carp`):

```sh
CARP_BENCH_RUNS=3 ./bench/compiler-generations.sh
```

It reports wall time, user time, and maximum resident set size, writes the raw
measurements as TSV, and checks that the C emitted by gen 1 and gen 2 reaches a
fixed point. Linking each next-generation compiler is deliberately excluded
from the timed region.

`bench/nbody-codegen.sh` checks exact output parity with reference Carp and
requires the generated hot loop to materialize its stable array data pointer.
It also reports reference/generated executable runtime without imposing a
noise-sensitive CI timing threshold.

The assurance harness keeps the self-host honest:

- `scripts/run-assurance.sh phase` runs every phase/session suite, lint, and
  formatting. Set `CARP_SKIP_STYLE=1` when the two style tools are unavailable.
  Set `CARP_PHASE_JOBS=2` to run the independent module and root test groups
  concurrently; CI uses this mode on both architectures.
- `scripts/run-assurance.sh self` builds gen 1, runs the reference suite,
  checks the self-hosted fixed point, and compares expansion behavior. Set
  `CARP_SELF_JOBS=2` to split the reference suite across isolated workers; CI
  uses this mode on both architectures.
- `scripts/run-assurance.sh all` runs both groups and is the default. CI calls
  the same phase and self groups rather than maintaining its own command list.

- `scripts/run-carp-suite-self.sh` runs the reference repository's own test
  suite (examples, produces-output diffs, `test/*.carp`, error-rejection
  tests, bench builds) through this compiler. It finds the reference checkout
  through `CARP_ROOT` or `CARP_DIR`, and `CARP_COMPILER` can point it at a
  gen-2 binary.
- `scripts/diff-expansion.sh` compiles and runs a front-end corpus (macros,
  quasiquote, gensym, dynamic evaluation) under both the reference compiler
  and this one and requires identical observable output.

## Examples

The programs in `examples/` double as checkpoints. The standalone ones need no
standard library:

| example                    | shows                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `simple.carp`              | functions, `if`, a registered C primitive                    |
| `hello.carp`               | `deftemplate` inline C; prints `OK`                          |
| `nominal.carp`             | `deftype` sum type, `match` with a wildcard field            |
| `polymorphic-nominal.carp` | one polymorphic type specialized at two instances            |
| `nested-pattern.carp`      | nested constructor patterns                                  |
| `signature-nominal.carp`   | layout discovery from a signature, no reachable constructor  |
| `squares.carp`             | the full standard library (needs `--core`)                   |

## How it works

Source flows through fifteen phase libraries, each with its own directory,
data model, and tests:

```
source registry
  -> carp-module      module loading, load-order and git-reference resolution
  -> carp-surface     lossless surface parsing
  -> carp-expand      macro expansion (with carp-ct-env / carp-ct-eval)
  -> carp-resolve     name resolution into the core IR (carp-ir)
  -> carp-infer       Hindley–Milner type inference (carp-types)
  -> carp-specialize  interface selection and monomorphization
  -> carp-ownership   ownership planning and flow-sensitive borrow checking
  -> carp-backend     lowering and C emission (carp-c-abi for mangling)
  -> one C translation unit
```

Supporting libraries: `carp-primitives` (the declarative primitive registry) and
`carp-graph` (strongly-connected-component ordering), plus `carp-source`
(caller-owned source identities and byte spans) and `carp-session` (warm,
transactional notebook inference). Each phase reports failures tagged with its
own name.

Ownership is real: the compiler derives `delete`/`copy` for managed `deftype`s
(concrete and generic), runs a sound flow-sensitive borrow check (escape, move,
borrow-after-move, branch joins), and emits the corresponding C cleanup. The
delete plan covers let scopes, unconsumed parameters, discarded intermediates,
`set!` overwrites, by-value `match` bindings (used or not), and the payloads a
wildcard pattern drops — with deep deleters and copiers for nested containers.
Escaping closures heap-allocate their environments.

The reusable entry point is `CarpCompiler.compile-source`, or
`CarpCompiler.compile-sources` when the caller already holds an in-memory source
registry.

## Session library

[`carp-session`](carp-session/README.md) keeps an inferred core resident for
notebook and editor clients, then provides transactional definition updates,
cell-relative typed reports, ownership queries, completion, and incremental
code generation. The design deliberately leaves transport and value hosting to
clients such as Lepiter and GT. [`docs/carp-session.md`](docs/carp-session.md)
records the original design and implementation history.

## Limitations

- The host architecture and OS are stamped for the build machine
  (`aarch64`/`darwin`) in the `--core` path.
- Delete placement is scope-based, not liveness-based: values die at scope or
  branch exit rather than after their last use, so peak memory can exceed the
  reference compiler's on the same program.
- A binding consumed on one control-flow path and reassigned later leaks the
  reassigned value (the plan is any-path conservative; it never double-frees).
- Error messages are deliberately this compiler's own; only rejection behavior
  matches the reference, not diagnostic text.
